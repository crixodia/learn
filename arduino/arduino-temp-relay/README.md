# Relay control based on temperature

Control the relay based on the temperature from a DHT11 sensor. It has a configurable minimum and maximum temperature that the relay will be turned on. The components used are:

* Arduino Uno R3
* DHT11 sensor
* 5V Relay
* A LED
* 2 x 10K potentiometers
* 16x2 LCD

## Files

You are provided with the required [libraries](libraries/arduino/) and the source code. And also a schematic of the [components](libraries/fritzing/) used for Proteus and Fritzing with its [Arduino Library](libraries/proteus/).

You must use the [.hex](source_arduino/source_arduino.ino.with_bootloader.standard.hex) file if you want to simulate the Arduino Uno R3 on Proteus.
